A Service Desk is a ticket management system which allows enterprises to implement strong and effective work-flows for internal and customer-facing support departments.
	The Support Ticketing Management System (also called as Help Desk or Help Desk Ticketing System or Remote Help Desk Support System), enables MSPs (through administrators and help desk staff) to keep track of tickets raised by users, attend to them, reassign them to appropriate department or organizations, and generate reports and more.
	The most known IT Service Desk systems are:

- ManageEngine Service Desk Plus
- Jira Service Desk
- MSP Anywhere
- Freshdesk
- LiveAgent
- Comodo Service Desk
